abstract = {An ever growing interest and wide adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) and Web technologies are unleashing a true potential of designing a broad range of high-quality consumer applications. Smart cities, smart buildings, and e-health are among various application domains which are currently benefiting and will continue to benefit from IoT and Web technologies in a foreseeable future. Similarly, semantic technologies have proven their effectiveness in various domains and a few among multiple challenges which semantic Web technologies are addressing are to (i) mitigate heterogeneity by providing semantic inter-operability, (ii) facilitate easy integration of data application, (iii) deduce and extract new knowledge to build applications providing smart solutions, and (iv) facilitate inter-operability among various data processes including representation, management and storage of data.In this tutorial, our focus will be on the combination of Web technologies, Semantic Web, and IoT technologies and we will present to our audience that how a merger of these technologies is leading towards an evolution from IoT to Web of Things (WoT) to Semantic Web of Things. This tutorial will introduce the basics of Internet of Things, Web of Things and Semantic Web and will demonstrate tools and techniques designed to enable the rapid development of semantics-based Web of Things applications. One key aspect of this tutorial is to familiarize its audience with the open source tools designed by different semantic Web, IoT and WoT based projects and provide the audience a rich hands-on experience to use these tools and build smart applications with minimal efforts. Thus, reducing the learning curve to its maximum. We will showcase real-world use case scenarios which are designed using semantically-enabled WoT frameworks (e.g. CityPulse, FIESTA-IoT and M3).},

Defining characteristics of the Fog are: a) Low latency and location awareness; b) Wide-spread geographical distribution; c) Mobility; d) Very large number of nodes, e) Predominant role of wireless access, f) Strong presence of streaming and real time applications, g) Heterogeneity. In this paper we argue that the above characteristics make the Fog the appropriate platform for a number of critical Internet of Things (IoT) services and applications, namely, Connected Vehicle, Smart Grid, Smart Cities, and, in general, Wireless Sensors and Actuators Networks (WSANs).},

abstract = {The interoperability problems that originate from the heterogeneity in protocols and platforms is one of the main challenges currently faced by the Internet of Things (IoT). The Web of Things (WoT) is an architectural solution to this issue based on leveraging the Web as a means to ensure interoperability. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is currently behind one of the most relevant WoT initiatives—a group of building blocks to serve as a possible foundation for the WoT. This work describes an experimental framework based on the W3C WoT, including a set of concrete and original protocol binding implementations (HTTP, Websockets, MQTT and CoAP). One of the main novelties is that all protocol binding implementations have support for all interaction verbs from the WoT interaction model. The framework is especially adequate to build WoT applications for devices on all layers of the fog computing model; this multi-layer integration is achieved by leveraging the W3C WoT architecture and interaction model. A functional implementation in Python is also described, including low-level designs and implementation details for the binding templates. The behavior of the framework and the protocol bindings is studied by implementing a benchmark application under multiple conditions and hardware platforms. Finally, recommendations are extracted from the obtained results for the most adequate protocols for each scenario and interaction verb.}

SOSA is the result of rethinking the W3C-XG Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology based on changes in scope and target audience, technical developments, and lessons learned over the past years. SOSA also acts as a replacement of SSN’s Stimulus Sensor Observation (SSO) core. It has been developed by the first joint working group of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) on Spatial Data on the Web. In this work, we motivate the need for SOSA, provide an overview of the main classes and properties, and briefly discuss its integration with the new release of the SSN ontology as well as various other alignments to specifications such as OGC’s Observations and Measurements (O&M), Dolce-Ultralite (DUL), and other prominent ontologies. We will also touch upon common modelling problems and application areas related to publishing and searching observation, sampling, and actuation data on the Web. The SOSA ontology and standard can be accessed at https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/.}
